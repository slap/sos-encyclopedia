Hilbert described a method (non constructive) to produce counter examples in the
2 crucial cases, but no explicit examples appeared in literature for next 80 years.
In 1967 Motzkin presented a specific example of a ternary sextic form that is
positive semidefinite but not a sum of squares.

The Motzkin polynomial is
$$
M(x,y) = x^4 y^2 + x^2 y^4 - 3x^2 y^2 + 1.
$$
or as homogeneous form
$$
M(x,y) = z^6 + x^4 y^2 + x^2 y^4 - 3x^2 y^2 z^2.
$$
